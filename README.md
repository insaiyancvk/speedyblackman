# An AI that plays NFS Rivals

> Note: "speedyblackman" is [YT/Blackpanthaa](https://www.youtube.com/c/Blackpanthaa)'s IGN.

Here's the plan:

- Three different models on three different datasets. 
    1. Acceleration, break, reverse frames
    2. Left, right turn frames
    3. Nitro frames

- Work on left/right dataset first, then acceleration/break dataset then nitro dataset.
- Implement _speedyblackman_.

Vague TODO:
- Create dataloader for the dataset working with and save the copy to drive.
- Test the dataset on different models.
