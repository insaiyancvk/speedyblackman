# An AI that plays NFS Rivals

> Note: "speedyblackman" is [YT/Blackpanthaa](https://www.youtube.com/c/Blackpanthaa)'s IGN.

Here's the plan:

- Work on left/right dataset first, then acceleration/break dataset then nitro dataset.

Vague TODO:
- Create dataloader for the dataset working with and save the copy to drive.
- Test the dataset on different models.
- Connect the script with the game.
